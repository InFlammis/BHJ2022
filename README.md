# Victoria

Color up your dark thoughts.

Victoria is a metaphor for all those thoughts that cage us.

The player finds himself trapped in a highly geometric, almost impossible, structure from which he must escape.

A series of mobs and bosses hinder him in his purpose, and try to overwhelm him darkening the world with black ink. 

The player, a stylus, can eliminate them with jets of colored ink that remain on the playing field and permanently fill up the level.

The choice of colors and the type of ink jet therefore determines both the player's survival and the final artistic result.
